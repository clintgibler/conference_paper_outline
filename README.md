Conference Paper Outline
========================

This repo contains the basic outline I use for writing conference papers using LaTeX.

Nothing too fancy here currently, just thought it might be useful to provide so people can compare/contrast with what they do.

Have a favorite LaTeX hack/macro? Would love to see it.
